{"name":"An App of Ice and Fire","tagline":"The app-that-never-was for java servlets and front-end development.","body":"## Synopsis\r\n\r\nThis is the \"IBM ConnectED 2015 App-That-Never-Was\", as my session became a Chalk Talk.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes, this _could_ have been the app I was going to demonstrate, with some key exceptions. I am providing this repository as a demonstration of what a \"modern, front-end JS heavy, Java servlet (with business logic) based app\" can be. For more information, please consult [my blog's series on servlets](//edm00se.io/servlet-series/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nClone the _master_ branch of this repository into a directory of your choice. Then, in DDE's Package Explorer, perform an import of \"Existing Project into Workspace\", selecting the NSF directory in this repository. Right-click on the project, select \"Team Development\" then \"Associate with New NSF\".\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis application, as my blog series describes, requires some JAR files to be contained within the _<Domino install>/jvm/lib/ext/_ path.\r\n\r\n* [com.google.Gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)\r\n* [Apache Commons IOUtils](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/)\r\n* a notes.ini edit (add _HTTPEnableMethods=PUT,DELETE_ next to your local web preview port) OR adding PUT and DELETE as allowed methods in your Internet Site document for your server\r\n\r\nI've marked where I've used GSON in my Java classes and have almost entirely provided the working _com.ibm.commons.util.io.json_ equivalent. You can also manually work around the Apache Commons libraries, as they're mostly just helper utilities. I do recommend using them though, so if you can't access your server's file system, you can import them into the NSF.\r\n\r\nFor reasoning on why I recommend placing those JARs on your server, please consult [my blog post on the subject](//edm00se.io/xpages/a-quick-note-on-JARs).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAs is my norm for my blog and my GitHub repositories, the work contained herein is licensed under a <a href=\"//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>.
